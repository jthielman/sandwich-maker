# Sandwich Maker

## Description
This app allows a user to choose ingredients for a sandwich.  The user has a choice of breads, cheeses, meats, veggies and condiments.  When the Enter button is clicked, the user's chosen ingredients are listed along with their unrealistically low prices at the bottom of the page, along with the total price.  There is also an ORDER SANDWICH button, which, when clicked, causes an alert to inform the user that no sandwich is forthcoming after all.
